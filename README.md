# assembla_validation_gui
Gui for validating apps in realtime



- Step 1: create a file named as "creds_personal.py"
place your assembla scret keys inside it, for example:
access_key= "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";
access_secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";

- Step 2: place this "creds_personal.py" in the same directory where you are cloning this.

- Step 3: double click on "run.bat" to run the program.

This takes gc code as an input (it should be integer value), and if errors are found, it will write in json file and show the error message as popup.
